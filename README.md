# Rainfall-prediction
## Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation of precipitation prediction using the ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) method. The ARMA model is a popular statistical method used for time series analysis and forecasting, making it suitable for predicting precipitation patterns based on historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Time series decomposition
- ARMA model fitting
- Model diagnostics and validation
- Rainfall prediction and visualization

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the example notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
```
### Installation
1 - Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Maaaadox/Rainfall-prediction.git
cd Rainfall-prediction
```
2 - Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage

1 - Data Preparation: Ensure your rainfall data is in a suitable time series format (e.g., CSV file with date and rainfall columns). Place your dataset in the Datasets/ directory.

2 - Code Execution : Adjust the parametres based on your dataset and run the code !.

3 - Visualization : Visualize the plots of the compatison between original and forecasted data .
