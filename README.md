# Rainfall-prediction
## Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation of precipitation prediction using the ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average) method. The ARMA model is a popular statistical method used for time series analysis and forecasting, making it suitable for predicting precipitation patterns based on historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Time series decomposition
- ARMA model fitting
- Model diagnostics and validation
- Rainfall prediction and visualization
