# Rainfall-prediction
## Overview
This repository contains a complete implementation of precipitation prediction using the ARMA/ARIMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average/AutoRegressive integrated Moving Average) method. The ARMA/Arima models are a popular statistical methods used for time series analysis and forecasting, making it suitable for predicting precipitation patterns based on historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Time series decomposition
- ARMA model fitting
- Model diagnostics and validation
- Rainfall prediction and visualization

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need the following software and libraries installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the example notebooks)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib seaborn
```
### Installation
1 - Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Maaaadox/Rainfall-prediction.git
